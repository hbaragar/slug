	* Incorporated many of lhunath's suggestions from 2008-07-24 at
	  http://eigenclass.org/hiki/gibak-backup-system-introduction to
	  make the gibak script more robust about spaces/quoting.  I am
	  not a bash expert, and there are no unit tests, so I wasn't 
	  comfortable making some of the more involved changes
	  (e.g. changing test to [[) on my own.  I'm also not sure if
	  we actually rely on some of the side effects of unquoted $@,
	  but time will tell.
	
	* Change perform_utime to use Nativeint (32-bit) instead of
	  int (31-bit); this fixes the "timestamp set to 1940" problem.

	* Incorporate Eric Pollmann's suggestions from 2008-04-08 at
	  http://eigenclass.org/hiki/gibak-0.3.0.  These make 
	  ometastore tolerant of files it can't access, and add
	  better reporting when it encounters unknown problems.

	* Store xattr strings with a 4-byte length, not a 2-byte length.  
	  This fixes errors like "Fatal error: exception Invalid_argument 
	  ("String.sub")" when files had long xattrs - e.g., Mac resource
	  forks on OS X HFS files.

    	  NOTE: This is a breaking change to the format of .ometastore; I
 	  don't know OCAML, so I'm not confident enough to add a data 
	  version number to the file.  It's not a bad idea, though.

	* Might as well start a changelog.
