slug -- snapshots using git
=================================
slug creates a Git repository of your $HOME directory.  That is it takes a 
snapshot/backup of it using Git.

Since slug builds upon the infrastructure offered by Git, it shares its main
strengths:
* speed: recovering your data is faster that cp -a...
* full revision history
* space-efficient data store, with file compression and textual/binary deltas
* efficient transport protocol to replicate the backup (faster than rsync)

slug uses Git's hook system to save and restore the information Git doesn't
track itself such as permissions, empty directories and optionally mtime
fields.

History
=======
slub mostly is "gibak" with some improvements.  I seem to have a lot of trouble
typing "gibak" and "gibak commit" (which just doesn't make sense to me).  So
I renamed it slug (following the meme use for name "git") and will changed the
"commit" command to "it".  I probably will add a "slug outta-here" to do a
"slug it" followed by a "git push".


Dependencies
============
slug needs the following software at run-time:
* git (tested with git version 1.5.4.2, might work with earlier versions)
* rsync >= 2.6.4 (released on 30 March 2005), used to manage nested git
  repositories (submodules)
* common un*x userland: bash, basename, pwd, hostname, cut, grep,
  egrep, date...

It needs the following software to compile:
* ocaml (tested with version 3.10.1 and 3.10.2)
* omake 
* ocaml-fileutils
* Findlib

To install dependencies on Mac:
* sudo port install git-core rsync caml-findlib omake
* There is no port for ocaml-fileutils; you'll have to build it from source at http://le-gall.net/sylvain+violaine/download/ocaml-fileutils-latest.tar.gz

Installation
============

(1) Verify the compilation parameters in OMakefile. The defaults should work
in most cases, but you might need to change a couple variables:
* include paths for the caml headers, required in some OCaml setups
* support for extended attributes. Tested on Linux and OSX.

(2) run

 $ omake

(3) copy the following executables to a directory in your path:

  find-git-files
  find-git-repos
  slug
  ometastore

Usage
=====
Run slug without any options to get a help message.

The normal workflow is:

 $ slug init         # run once to initialize the backup system
 $ vim .gitignore    # edit to make sure you don't import unwanted files
                     # edit .gitignore files in other subdirectories
                     # you can get a list of the files which will be saved
                     # with  find-git-files  or  slug ls-new-files
 $ slug it           # the first slug-it will be fairly slow, but the following
                     # ones will be very fast

.... later ....

 $ slug it

The backup will be placed in $HOME/.git. "Nested Git repositories" will be
rsync'ed to $HOME/.git/git-repositories and they will be registered as
submodules in the main Git repository (run  git help submodule  for more
information on submodules). You might want to use a cronjob to save snapshots
of the repositories in $HOME/.git/git-repositories 

After you slug init, $HOME becomes a git repository, so you can use normal git
commands. If you use "slug it", however, new files will automatically be
added to the repository if they are not ignored (as indicated in your
.gitignore files), so you'll normally prefer it to "git commit".

About the backup store
----------------------
The backup data is placed in $HOME/.git. You can mount an external disk there
if you want your backup to reside in a different physical disk for resiliency
against disk crashes. You can also clone the repository (probably using a bare
repository --- without working tree --- for smaller space usage) and rsync
.git/git-repositories to remote machines for further protection.

Multiple machines
-----------------
You can clone your home directory on another machine, but it's a little 
tricky: git won't let you clone into an existing directory.  Also, git won't
copy the links in .git/hooks, which we use to update the metadata on each
checkout.  Be sure that your UID and GUID are the same on both machines!

So, to clone from your desktop to your laptop, do this on the laptop:

1. Copy over slug and ometastore to a directory in your path
/Users/bob$ sudo -s
/Users/bob# cd /usr/local/bin
/usr/local/bin# scp desktop:/usr/local/bin/slug .
/usr/local/bin# scp desktop:/usr/local/bin/ometastore .

1. Do the initial clone

/usr/local/bin# cd ~bob
/Users/bob# cd ..
/Users# mkdir bob-temp
/Users# git clone desktop:.git bob-temp
/Users# ls bob-temp
Documents/
Library/
...etc...
/Users# mv bob-temp/* /Users/bob

This will fail to move any directories that already exist in your 
home directory.  I'm sure there's a nice, safe way around that, so someone
should update these docs with that magic solution.

2. Link the hooks and update your metadata:

/Users# cd bob
/Users/bob# ln -s .git-hooks/* .git/hooks
/Users/bob# .git/hooks/post-checkout
...any errors will be displayed...

3. Recommit
/Users/bob# exit
/Users/bob$ slug it

4. Push back to the desktop

[THIS needs some serious documentation.  "git push" is NOT the way to go;
you can't push into a repository with an active working copy!  That will
leave desktop in a state where it incorrectly thinks it's out of date.

I haven't figured this part out yet, but clues are at:

http://hans.fugal.net/blog/2008/11/10/git-push-is-worse-than-worthless

and

http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitFaq#head-b96f48bc9c925074be9f95c0fce69bcece5f6e73

...]

5. Periodic synchronization

When you want to sync the laptop, just:

/Users/bob$ git pull
...
/Users/bob$ git that-magic-alternative-to-push-someone-wrote-about-in-step-4

Known Bugs
==========

* ometastore gets confused trying to do chown and utime on symlinks.  It spits a harmless error
  out, but this should be cleaned up.
