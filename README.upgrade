This file explains how to upgrade when you already have a slug backup.

Updating from the pre-release version
=====================================

(1) Install the latest version as described in README.txt.
(2) If you have compiled ometastore with support for extended attributes and
want to save/restore the xattrs, edit ~/.git/pre-commit and post-checkout and
add the "-x" option to the call to ometastore.
